# Micro Frontend (MFE) Example

This repository contains three microfrontend projects (one shell and two remotes) demostrating how they can work and communicate between them, even tho are completely separate projects.
This project was uploaded to Zephyr Cloud.

In this example, inside the shell microfrontends are set two other ones: sidebar and content. Inside sidebar you can press a button to add items, and it will be seen on the content microfrontend.
